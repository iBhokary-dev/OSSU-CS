### How can I review the math prerequisites?
Many OSSU students choose to review math topics that they have not studied recently.
OSSU recommends students use Khan Academy for such a review.
Below are links to topic assessments.
After taking an assessment, you should have a clear idea what topics to study, and resources on Khan Academy to use.

- [Arithmetics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic#arithmetic-subject-challenge)
- [Basic Geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo#basic-geo-subject-challenge)
- [Pre-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra#pre-algebra-subject-challenge)
- [Integrated Math 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math1#math1-subject-challenge)
- [Integrated Math 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math2#math2-subject-challenge)
- [Integrated Math 3](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math3#math3-subject-challenge)

(Math 1, 2, 3 covers all of algebra, pre-calculus, high school geometry, trig, stats. It interleaves the order of these topics.)
